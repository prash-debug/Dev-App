Built a full stack Social app with ReactJS, Node, Express and MongoDB. Extensively used JWT for authentication. The app uses Socket.io for real time chatting between users via rooms.

Quick Start ðŸš€

Install server dependencies

Run both Express & React from root
npm run dev

Socket.io ðŸ’¬

Sockets have customarily been the solution around which most real-time chat frameworks are architected, giving a bi-directional communication channel between a client and a server. 
This implies that the server can push messages to clients. At whatever point you compose a chat message, the thought is that the server will get it and push it to all other associated clients.
